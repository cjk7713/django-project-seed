# Django Rest Framework Project Seed

A(nother) seed project for the django rest framework.

# Features

  -  [x] Built in Oauth2 Toolkit
  -  [x] Custom user model (That actually works with the default groups model)
  -  [x] Public User registration endpoint (Right now you can only create users in the admin section)
  
# How to use

Just create a virtualenv with Python 3.6.4 (That's the version I've used), install the requirements and migrate the database.
